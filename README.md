# Source
An Android/Windows game in the vein of a classic arcade space shooter.

Source was built as an exercise to familiarize myself with the Unity game engine. The goal of the game is to climb an endless level-ladder by destroying enemy ships.

All the art was created by myself using Inkscape. I apologize to all the real artists I have offended with my art. However, I will say, it was fun pretending to be an artist/animator.
