# Source
An Android/Windows game in the vein of a classic arcade space shooter.

Source was built as an exercise to familiarize myself with the Unity game engine. The goal of the game is to climb an endless level-ladder by destroying enemy ships.

All the art was created by myself using Inkscape. I apologize to all the real artists I have offended with my art. However, I will say, it was fun pretending to be an artist/animator.

Android controls:
  Move the ship by sliding your finger anywhere on the left half of the screen. 
  Shoot by tapping the anywhere on the right half of the screen.
  
Windows controls:
  WASD to control ship 
  Mouse-click to shoot
